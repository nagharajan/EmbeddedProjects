"# EmbeddedProjects" 

atmega folder contains projects built for Microchip ICs while STM32 contains project build for ICs from ST Microelectronics.

All files in this repository are free to use. The code were tested on atmega328p & atmega2560 ICs

I2C library is downloaded from http://www.electronicwings.com. 

Rest all files are created by me for various embedded projects.
